# FCC-ML-Journey
I finished the <b>Machine Learning with Python</b> course at www.freecodecamp.org in 2022. This repository is a reflection of my learning journey as it contains <b>Machine Learning with Python Projects</b>.
I revisited my projects and updated code to improve compatibility with libraries of 2024 versions. For instance, I use `Tensorflow 2.16.1` now.
